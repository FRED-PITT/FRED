#  This is the file the defines the vaccines that are in simulation for FRED
#  
#  This file is not column space dependent.  It is line dependent, so carriage returns can make a difference.
#
#  Anything after the # is not read and can contain comments
#
#  Some of these lines are not implemented, I note this below, they should eventually be implemented.
