Arkansas
Description:
Arkansas provided 5-year projections at county level to 2040 but without gender or age-grouping. County level age-group and gender proportions obtained from FRED 2010 population were applied to the county totals. This assumes that gender and age group proportions remain constant over the 40 year period.
