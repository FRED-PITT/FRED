Michigan
Description:
"Michigan provided county level by gender and 11 age groups in 10 year increments, rather than 18 age groups and 5 year increments. Some age groups were aggregated and then the proportion of each age group obtained from original FRED populations was applied to produce the 18 age groups. The 10 year increments were used to estimate the 5 year populations"
