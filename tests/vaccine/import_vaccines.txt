# Each data line must have the following format:
#
# start = %d end = %d max = %d per_cap = %f lat = %f lon = %f rad = %f fips = %ld min_age = %d max_age = %d
#
#
# On each simulation day between start and end inclusive, a selected
# number of susceptible people will be exposed.  If per_cap = 0, up to
# max candidates will be selected at random.  If the total number of
# candidates is less than max, then all candidates will be exposed.  If
# per_cap > 0, max is ignored and the number selected will be
# (per_cap*number_of_candidates).
#
# If fips = 0 and rad = 0, then all age-appropriate susceptible people
# in the simulation region are candidates for exposure.  If fips > 0,
# candidates will be selected from those residing in the given fips
# code. If fips = 0 and rad > 0, the candidates will selected those
# residing within rad km of the specified coordinates (lat,lon).
#
# Only individuals with min_age <= age and age < max_age will be
# included in the set of candidates.  Both min_age and max_age are real
# values. For example, setting min_age = 2.5 and max_age = 10 includes
# only people who are at least 2.5 years old but less than 10 years old.
# It is an error to specify max_age <= min_age.
