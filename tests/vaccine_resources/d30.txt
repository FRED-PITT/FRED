# Each data line must have the following format:
#
# start = %d end = %d max = %d per_cap = %f lat = %f lon = %f rad = %f fips = %ld
#
# On each simulation day between start and end inclusive, the specified
# amount of resources will be delivered to the given location. If
# per_cap = 0, max units will be delivered.  If per_cap > 0, max is
# ignored and the amount delivered will be (per_cap*number_of_people).
# If fips = 0 and rad = 0, then all people in the simulation region are
# counted.  If fips > 0, then only those residing in the given fips code
# will count. If fips = 0 and rad > 0, then people residing within rad
# km of the specified coordinates (lat,lon) will be counted.
